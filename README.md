This app is an internal management tool for Hodeia Digital company (Bilbao, Spain). This environment is developed to classify projects and users, assign tasks, allocate hours to each user, create new users, new clients... The Front-End development has been carried out with Javascript and React technology and the Back-End with Nest.js and MongoDB.
When creating a new task in the tasks section, by dragging with the mouse you can assign the hours or weeks that are given to each project or task, to which a modal box appears in which the details of the task are described and what part of which project it belongs to. This is stored in the database and stored as pending.
Also in the projects section you can assign a new task, epic or feature to a new project or an existing project. This is stored in the database.
All this makes it a functional and effective application for the internal organization of the company.
